# Dependency management

The Uno Bootstrapper uses RequireJS for dependency management, allowing for dependencies to be resolved in a stable manner.

For instance, a script defined this way, placed in the `WasmScripts` folder:

```javascript
define(() => {
    var txt = document.createTextNode("Loaded !");
    var parent = document.getElementById('uno-body');
    parent.insertBefore(txt, parent.lastChild);
});
```

will be executed appropriately.

Dependencies can also be declared this way:

```javascript
define([], function() { return MyModule; });
```

If you're taking a dependency on an [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) enabled library, you'll need to publish the library as it would outside of the normal require flow.

As an example, to be able to use [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/):

- Add the `html2canvas.js` file as an `EmbeddedResource` in the `WasmScripts` folder
- Then create an additional file called `myapp.js`, also as an `EmbeddedResource`

  ```javascript
  require([`${config.uno_app_base}/html2canvas`], c => window.html2canvas = c);
  ```

- You'll then be able to access `window.html2canvas` from C# using `eval()`.

## Using multiple dependencies

In some cases, the simple inclusion of dependencies may allow for defining a dependency graph.

To do so, here's an example of dependency graph:

- Add a `MyLib.js` file in the `WasmScripts` folder:

  ```javascript
  require(
      [`${config.uno_app_base}/Assets/js/test1`, `${config.uno_app_base}/Assets/js/test2`],
      (r1, r2) => {
          debugger;
      }
  );
  ```

  Make sure to set the `Build action` of the file to `EmbeddedResource`.
- Then create an `Assets/js` folder in your application, then add a file named `test1.js`:

  ```javascript
  console.log('test1.js loaded');
  define({name: "test1"});
  ```

- Finally, in an `Assets/js`, add a file named `test2.js`:

  ```javascript
  console.log('test2.js loaded');
  define({ name: "test2" });
  ```

When running the application, the `MyLib.js` file will be loaded first, then will automatically register the `test1.js` and `test2.js` file to be recursively loaded, where `r1` and `r2` have the defined values in the dependencies.

### Dependency management for Emscripten

Emscripten modules initialization is performed in an asynchronous way and the Bootstrapper will ensure that a dependency that exposes a module will have finished its initialization for starting the `Main` method of the C# code.
